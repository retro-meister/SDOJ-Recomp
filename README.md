# SDOJ-Recomp

Dodonpachi Saidaioujou Recompilation using [rexglue](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk).

# Requirements

- Your own DoDonPachi Saidaioujou Xbox 360 ISO dump (MD5 366517C07EA2B1912F9B33F208C866BB)
- Title Update 1.01 file

# Known issues

### Slowdown

Slowdown is heavily tweaked compared to Xbox 360. The game is tuned to mostly match what you'd see playing on shmupmame 5.3.1, for both expert and regular modes. Xbox Arrange mode does **not** have any slowdown, as all the slowdown comes from the 360 lagging itself, thus, the slowdown will not be tuned for this mode.

### Other issues
- The render patch sometimes introduces graphical artificats
- The frame delievery is pretty bad right now, the game does not look very smooth unless you run it through Special K.
- Audio fadeout issues if not using Special K
  
# Building

### Windows

You need CMake 3.25 or newer, Ninja, LLVM/Clang with C++23 support, and the Visual Studio C++ build tools with a Windows SDK.

Make sure cmake, ninja, clang and clang++ are in PATH.

ReXGlue and all required dependencies are already included in the repo.

Run:

`cmake --preset win-amd64-release`
`cmake --build --preset win-amd64-release --parallel`

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

Install the build and Vulkan dependencies with Homebrew:

`brew install llvm cmake ninja molten-vk vulkan-loader`

For automatic first-launch ISO extraction, build and install [XboxDev/extract-xiso](https://github.com/XboxDev/extract-xiso) somewhere on `PATH` before configuring SDOJ-Recomp.

Run:

`cmake --preset mac-arm64-release`
`cmake --build --preset mac-arm64-release --parallel`

The executable, runtime libraries, and `launch.sh` are staged in `out/build/mac-arm64-release/`.

Put the SDOJ ISO and TU1 file there, then launch with:

```sh
cd out/build/mac-arm64-release
./launch.sh
```

### Linux

You need CMake 3.25 or newer, Ninja, and Clang with C++23 support. The linux-amd64-release preset looks for clang-20/clang++-20 specifically.

You'll also need a few system packages for the native UI, input and audio backends. On Debian/Ubuntu:

`sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libx11-xcb-dev libvulkan-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev`

ReXGlue and all required dependencies are already included in the repo.

Run:

`cmake --preset linux-amd64-release`
`cmake --build --preset linux-amd64-release --parallel`

After building, copy librexruntime.so and libTracyClient.so from thirdparty/rexglue-sdk/out/linux-amd64/ into the build output folder (out/build/linux-amd64-release/), next to the saidaioujou_recomp_tu1 executable. They aren't copied there automatically, and the executable won't start without them.

# First launch

1. Put SDOJ iso file in this folder, beside the recomp exe.
2. Put the TU_11LK1V7... TU1 file in the same folder.
3. Run `launch.bat` on Windows or `./launch.sh` on macOS/Linux.

The first launch extracts the ISO to game_data and installs the three TU1 patch
files.

For the later launches it verifies the existing game_data and
skips both extraction steps when they have already completed. After successful
setup, the ISO and TU container may be removed.

# Settings 

There are some hardcoded arguments in launch.bat/launch.sh. You can edit them as you wish, but don't remove `--xex_apply_patches=true`.

You can open the settings by pressing F4 in game. To turn on keyboard inputs, go to the Input tab and turn on mnk_mode. For best latency, it is recommneded to use input_backend set to xinput. To achieve more consistent results, running the game through Special K is recommended. If you turn off VSync (it is disabled by default), you might have to cap the FPS manually to 60 via Special K or any other way.

The saved settings are stored in the saidaioujou_recomp_tu1.toml config file.

# Patches

The input lag fix (reduction from 3f to 1f) consists of 2 patches:

- The first patch polls the controller again and rebuilds the gameplay input mask right before the game copies it, instead of using the stale mask.
- The second patch runs the game's render callback batch earlier, waits for the buffer swap, and skips the original late calls. This saves another frame.

You can turn them off or on via editing the launch arguments in launch.bat/launch.sh. The arguments are `--render_patch` and `--input_patch`

The patches for both Normal and Arrange modes are in:

- `generated/default/saidaioujou_recomp_tu1_recomp.3.cpp`
- `generated/CA022100/saidaioujou_recomp_tu1_recomp.0.cpp`
- `generated/CA022100/saidaioujou_recomp_tu1_recomp.1.cpp`
- `generated/CA022110/saidaioujou_recomp_tu1_recomp.0.cpp`
- `generated/CA022110/saidaioujou_recomp_tu1_recomp.1.cpp`
